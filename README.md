This is a free client base open for anyone to build & add onto.
It includes example menus, buttons, patching systems, and functional features to help you get started.
All I ask is that proper credit is given.
All refs can be found inside the VRChat/Melonloader & VRChat/Melonloader/Managed
ReMod.Core.dll Goes inside the mods folder and is also found in the folder ClientBase.ReModCore/
